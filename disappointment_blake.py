                                                I added a simple function
to calculate intensity distribution across wavelengths, and I added this term
to the intensity calculation. I also stole some code from stackexchange that
calculates the RGB fractions of each wavelength to apply colours to the image.

The result is the right colour! The rings are a bit more... suspicious. It's
indistinguishable for low finesse, but at the value I've set here they're 
somewhat visible.
