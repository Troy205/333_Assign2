The disappointment 1 file is a quick test at producing a pretty image. It should not be taken as a physical simulation of the situation, but as just a test on producing color gradients, and it is a good starting place.

The disappointment 2 file then adds a theoretical calculation of the Brewster's angle, responsible for the fading on one axis instead of the previous trig function. We also now pretend that the polariser acts as an FP system, introducing finesse into the image.

I would recommend that the next steps are tuning the preliminary images or mapping out the physical equations describing the system better. If explaining the physics proves unnecessarily difficult, then making a simulation is also feasible.
